# Contributing Guide

Hello and welcome! Thank you for showing a modicum of interest in contributing to the CRUD application by at least opening this file!

## Goals

The main goal as stated in the [README](/README.md) is to give developers the ability to quickly create a microservice with nil boilerplate code. Yet also, allow for fine tuning and customization when desired.

## Branching

| Name         | Description                                     |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| v#.#.#-alpha | Used to integrate changes for the next release. |
| feature/\*   | Used to contribute new feature code.            |
| bugfix/\*    | Used to contribute code to fix a bug.           |
| test/\*      | Used to experiment with the code.               |

Beyond the initial directory style naming convention, feel free to name branches to your style. You could even have subdirectories like `feature/steven-rothwell/my-sweet-new-feature` to help identify which branches are yours.

### Features and Bugs

Prior to starting work on any new features or bug fixes, please raise an issue and it agreed upon. I would not want your hard work and time wasted on something I do not think belongs in the project.

Please ensure any new projects or newly added NuGet packages are agreed upon.

### New Branches

New branches should be created from `master`.

### Pull Requests

PRs should target the next `v#.#.#-alpha`. All PRs will be squashed and merged.

Fair warning, I am very particular with PRs. Please follow best practices, coding style, and naming conventions.
